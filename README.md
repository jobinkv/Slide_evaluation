# Slide Reading System Evaluation Protocol
Slide presentations have been successfully used for an efficient and effective way of classroom teaching in the last three decades. However, blind and visually impaired (VI) students are not benefited by this way of teaching due to their limitation in reading slides. This shortcoming motivates us to design a system which can generate audio sound corresponding to the reading order of each slide and can help the blind and VI students to understand and interpret the content of the slides. One way, this problem is posed as an image-to-markup language generation task. Extraction of meaningful regions like title, paragraph, list, equation, figure, table, etc from the slide image is the initial step. Due to the diversity of content, theme and layout of the slides, extraction of meaningful regions is a challenging task.
